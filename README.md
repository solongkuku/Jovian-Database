**Project Description**
The project shows how a database can be leveraged in Java Application to handle magnitude and variety of information pertaining to the qualitative and quantitative  aspects of a real or fictional objects.

In our case we have taken the example of tabulating the characteristics of a species in a database containing metrics describing multiple alien species.

_User Interface_
JavaFX tools were implemented in a Maven project. The scenes were built using xml code in an fxml file.
Then aesthetic styling was applied on the classes and/or particular objects using CSS.

_Database Implementation_

_UI logic_
The main class was implemented using various JavaFX libraries' classes such as Application, FXMLloader, Scene and Stage.

The user interaction was implemented using various JavaFX libraries' classes such as those described above and including Event class and Control class objects like buttons, labels and Menu items

For example a button click by the user prompts a method in the controller class that produces a predefined result such change of scene, displaying the database metrics' values etc.
